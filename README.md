MGT - Mobile GUI Testframework
============================

Keyword-Driven Testframework using Eclipse Plugins to include Testdrivers for different (mobile) platforms. 

This work has started as a thesis at the university. I upload it so me and others may develop new features and make it usable.

I finally managed to write something about the project in my blog. Any interested reader is welcome:
