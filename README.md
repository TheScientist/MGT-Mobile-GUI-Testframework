MGT - Mobile GUI Testframework
============================

Keyword-Driven Testframework using Eclipse Plugins to include Testdrivers for different (mobile) platforms. 

This work has started as a thesis at the university. I upload it so me and others may develop new features and make it usable.

The framework allows to model/write automated tests using keywords and to select an adapter that will execute the testmodel.
At the moment only an Android Adapter is implemented which uses Robotium.

After a first upload I will try to add some further documentation and introducing material.
